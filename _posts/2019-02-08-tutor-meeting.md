title: Week 4 - Meetings with tutor and Bettina
---

In addition to our group meeting, we also met our tutor Marcin for the first time this week, and met with Bettina Nissen to talk about her [Data Things](http://data-things.com/) which we felt were very relevant for our project.

## Tutor Meeting

We explained our different ideas to Marcin and discussed how to best proceed. Summary of the main outcomes:
* We could either start by picking the data we are going to use, or by choosing a 'shape' for our data souvenir. Since the data sources are relatively clear for us (a combination of the Festivals API and user-submitted data), we decided to start with the shape and then see what specific data would suit it best.
* He agreed that it would be good to be able to provide the souvenir to visitors straight away, so it should not be time-intensive to produce (i.e. likely no 3D printing).
* We agreed to use the protoyping workshop to test different souvenir shapes in paper and cardboard.
* We had a short discussion on collaboration within our group, because Marcin had gotten the impression we do not discuss and communicate as much as we could. The group agreed to make more of an effort to involve everyone in the project, to share ideas even if they might be difficult to express (in English), to support each other in finding the right words to share ideas with the group, and to give everyone as much time as they need to express something.

Ideas that came up:
* Consider representing different genres in the data souvenir (e.g. theatre, comedy)
* Idea for a data souvenir: a postcard that folds into an orgami-like shape in a particular way


## Meeting with Bettina

Bettina's website: [](http://data-things.com/)

We had asked Bettina to meet because we felt she would be able to give us more insight into her work and how it relates to our project idea. Bettina's research focused on 'data things' in general rather than just souvenirs, and an important part was to engage people with these objects. In that sense, the focus of our project is slightly different - our focus is to create objects that allow people to relate their experiences to it, which is different from engagement. Also, while the object's function is a souvenir, it need not be (only) physical, there could be a digital component. In general, Bettina encouraged us to continue with this project direction and made some helpful suggestions.
