# Week 3 - Group Brainstorming Session

During this session we brainstormed ideas for the project. Since our focus is data souvenirs we focused on three categories during our brainstorm; data, input and product. We used pieces of paper and indervidually wrote down ideas and put them in the relevant category. We then went through and discussed the ideas and picked the ones we liked ready to prototype in week 4. We then thought about the users needs/requirements and noted some things down.
