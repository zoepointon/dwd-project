title:  "Demo Week - Feedback"
---

In week 9 we did a demonstration of our work in progress. It went well and we got good feedback to improve our project. We plan to have these changes made by next Thursday.


Feedback points:

general feedback:
  * add a way of personalising, e.g. star events
  * show progress when selecting events somehow (e.g. timeline being built up on the right as you go)
  * instruction things seem clickable, change design to make it clear they are not!
  * remove purely decorative elements in the visualisation --> everything should somehow be based on data
  * put map at the bottom of the cube, maybe show time axis
  * labels for the events? show them on zoom?
  * 'select events' --> more descriptive title, select all events you have attended
  * in general, more descriptive labels etc., more of a story/narrative, explain more to the user

bugs/missing features:
* general:
  * working links + bit.ly-fier
  * at the end: update video on first slide
  * increase contrast

* select page:
  * select specific date of each event (or find a non-skewed way of randomly picking them
  * show a number of events divisible by 3, show more --> 99
  * make whole card clickable
  * find a way of making date selects usable
  * nicer squared pictures (clipping masks?) + make pink on select
  * fix filters and make it smaller
  * add bar on the left for selected events, allow 'cards' of selected events to wrap text
  * touch keyboard

* visualisation:
  * zoom has to be fixed
  * change text: select angle you want to print
  
* for the show:
  * find some people who went to the 2018 festival and get a list of events they attended as examples for show visitors to 'reenact'
