title:  "Demo Week - Feedback"
---

In week 9 we did a demonstration of our work in progress.


After the groups were formed in week 2 of the semester, we had our first group meeting in week 3. We used this meeting to discuss our interests, generate ideas for potential projects, and settle on a preliminary idea.

All of us were interested in the issue of tickets having sentimental value and often being kept as souvenirs, which is not possible for digital tickets. Yet, digital tickets have many advantages over paper tickets. We therefore decided to address this in our project by focusing on creating a data-based souvenir of some kind.

We came up with the following triangle to summarise our direction:

Next week, we plan to further develop this idea. To that end, we have scheduled a meeting with Bettina Nissen, who has worked on data souvenirs in the past, and plan to have another group meeting to brainstorm ideas.



Feedback points:

general feedback:
  * add a way of personalising, e.g. star events
  * show progress when selecting events somehow (e.g. timeline being built up on the right as you go)
  * instruction things seem clickable, change design to make it clear they are not!
  * remove purely decorative elements in the visualisation --> everything should somehow be based on data
  * put map at the bottom of the cube, maybe show time axis
  * labels for the events? show them on zoom?
  * 'select events' --> more descriptive title, select all events you have attended
  * in general, more descriptive labels etc., more of a story/narrative, explain more to the user

bugs/missing features:
* general:
  * working links + bit.ly-fier
  * at the end: update video on first slide
  * increase contrast

* select page:
  * select specific date of each event (or find a non-skewed way of randomly picking them
  * show a number of events divisible by 3, show more --> 99
  * make whole card clickable
  * find a way of making date selects usable
  * nicer squared pictures (clipping masks?) + make pink on select
  * fix filters and make it smaller
  * add bar on the left for selected events, allow 'cards' of selected events to wrap text
  * touch keyboard

* visualisation:
  * zoom has to be fixed
  * change text: select angle you want to print
  
* for the show:
  * find some people who went to the 2018 festival and get a list of events they attended as examples for show visitors to 'reenact'
