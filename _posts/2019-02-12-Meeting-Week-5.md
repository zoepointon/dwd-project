title: Meeting Week 5 - Prototyping
---

In this week we completed our project plan and started to make prototypes for our installation.

## Group Meeting
We made out the proposal for our project. "...Physical tickets often have sentimental value and are kept as souvenirs. For digital tickets, this is not possible, yet they have many advantages over paper tickets. During the festivals, visitors will see many different shows, data about which can be used to create a souvenir that summarises the experience overall and contains references to all events the person visited. In our project, we are going to design the data souvenir itself (its physical shape and possibly digital extensions, e.g. AR), as well as a vending machine to create it (obtaining visitorsâ€™ data on which shows they visited, obtaining additional data about the events, creating the artefact from the data, printing the postcard). "

## Paper Prototyping Workshop
At first our idea was to set up a "stand" and connect an iPad to a printer. The user would follow the instructions on the iPad and enter his data, and then customized postcards would be printed and ready to collect when the operation was complete. By scanning the QR code on the postcard, the user could see the 3D model based on his data on his mobile phone. Later we realized that designing a vending machine with a display screen and a printer would match the flow we designed more.

## Tutor meeting
Marcin suggested that we could consider the possibility of payment methods, but that would be difficult to realize, considering the licence and legality, etc. Also We found difficulties on building and displaying AR. For example, we need an app on user's phone to run AR, but it will be tricky to transfer data to the app. We were still trying hard to figure out the problems.
