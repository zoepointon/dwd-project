title: Meeting Week 8 - Style Guide Session
---


This week our main topic of discussion was visual design. We reviewed our moodboard of insperation images and chose to make the 'theme' space and constilations. Because of this we chose a black to mid grey tones background palette. We chose bright yellow for our primary colour as the Edinburgh Festival uses bright yellow on their website. We wanted to reflect the festival brand so customers can easily identify the vending machine as associated with the festival. We chose bright blue to pink tones for the secondary colours. These colours were chosen as they directly contrast with the primary yellow creating a bold but viually pleasing pallette as a whole.

## Conclusion
The style guide will be used as a refrence point to keep the work we do indervidually consistant.
