title: Meeting Week 4 - Group Brainstorming Session
---



During this session we brainstormed ideas for the project. Since our focus is data souvenirs we focused on three categories during our brainstorm; data, input and product. We used pieces of paper and individually wrote down ideas and put them in the relevant category. We then went through and discussed the ideas and picked the ones we liked ready to prototype in week 4. We then thought about the users needs/requirements and noted some things down.


## Data -
Ideas - Weather, location, favourite, events,

## Input -
For the input we want to create an interaction that would make the user feel asif they were helping create the souvenir in some way, as well as using their own data.

Ideas - Google forms, webpage, touch screen display, mobile app.
