title:  "First Meeting - Initial Ideas"
---

After the groups were formed in week 2 of the semester, we had our first group meeting in week 3. We used this meeting to discuss our interests, generate ideas for potential projects, and settle on a preliminary idea.

All of us were interested in the issue of tickets having sentimental value and often being kept as souvenirs, which is not possible for digital tickets. Yet, digital tickets have many advantages over paper tickets. We therefore decided to address this in our project by focusing on creating a data-based souvenir of some kind.

We came up with the following triangle to summarise our direction:

Next week, we plan to further develop this idea. To that end, we have scheduled a meeting with Bettina Nissen, who has worked on data souvenirs in the past, and plan to have another group meeting to brainstorm ideas.



Other topics that we were interested in, but that we are not pursuing further for now, include:

* tackling choice anxiety ('flip a coin', but then for thousands of events)
* locals (including them as audience, dealing with the festivals taking over their city)
* sustainability
* audience reviews/'death of the reviewer'
