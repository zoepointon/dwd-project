title: Meeting Week X - Title
---



Above here, leave the first line as it is, change the second line to include the correct week and a short title for the blog post (i.e. what we did in the meeting).

## This is how you write a heading

If you want to add an image, upload the image to the img folder, then change the line below to link to your image (you'll only need to change the file name)

* You can write bulleted lists if you want
* You can make things **bold** or *italic*
