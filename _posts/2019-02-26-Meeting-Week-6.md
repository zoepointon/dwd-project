title: Meeting Week 6 
---



In this week, we decided to use WebGL to display personalized models and had a preliminary idea of our shape design.

## Tutorial Session
At today's meeting, we expressed the difficulties in making dynamic models with real-time data input by tourists in Augmented Reality.  Dave suggested us to focus on the most important part of the project and what kind of demo we want to display in week 9. He also said that it was better to make a machine than just a laptop and printer. Considering the difficulty and limited time of making AR product, we decided to give up this idea and turned to WebGL.

## Shape Design
The shape design on souvenirs and website is the most critical part of our project. During today's discussion, everyone drew their own idea and we tried to find a common and solid idea from this process.

We want to make a 3D shape using location and time as coordinates, and when visitors look from the top, they will get a two dimensional map without time, just the events or locations they have been at. The background picture of it is like a universe and the shape is similar to constellation.
