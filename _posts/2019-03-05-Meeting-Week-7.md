title: Meeting Week 7-Storyboarding Session
---



During the discussion session, everyone drew the storyboard of our project and we discussed whether we need put QR code in every postcard because some people do not know what it is. At the same time, we talked about if we need to store tourist's data in our database or just store the API in our database, then give the specific id and the common link to the tourists, they just need to alter the postfix of the link to their own, they can watch their own data visualization image.

## Design Session
At today's lecture, Marco Mason emphasized the project should be attractive enough and the importance of WHY.

## Feedback
After we explained the process of our project to Marco, he asked our why people will try our project? How can our project stand out from other projects? Where to set our vending machine? Why tourists care about our machine? All of these questions can help us perfect our project and become more competitive. Meanwhile, he gave us some useful suggestions as well. Firstly, to make our project more visible, we can switch the small screen to large screen or do some decorations to the box. Secondly, we can settle our vending machine near the gift shop so if people wants to buy souvenir in the gift shop, then we can introduce our project to them. Thirdly, attracting people's attention at the beginning, because some tourists need to catch the train or they are too tired to stand in front of the machine over five minutes. Fourthly, in the postcard part, he advised us making an extra story about the tourist's experience in the Fringe.

## Conclusion
During our group meeting, we decided to store tourist's data in the link rather than the database which can avoid violating people's privacy. People can just scan the QR code or click the link to watch their own visulazation image. Also we decided the color of the website and the font of the words (Audiowide), we thought that the first page of our website can be a video or some examples of souvenir. We do not need the map of the university, we just need the longitude and latitude to confirm the event point and put it in the exact coordinate. At the same time, we thought we can have a keyboard which can be shown when people want to input data. After the meeting, we talked about the future plan for our physical installation, we want to use shelf instead of box, using paper or board cover the else space just leaving a space to lay the laptop (screen). And we can use our budget to buy a printer and place it on the lower part of the shelf. For the postcard, in the frontage, it can be the screenshot of the visualization image; in the reverse side, it has a QR code, the introduction of the Edinburgh Festival or our project and some empty spaces for the tourists to write down what they thought.
