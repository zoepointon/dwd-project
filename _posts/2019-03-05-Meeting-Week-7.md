title: Meeting Week 7-Storyboarding Session
---



During the discussion session, everyone drew the storyboard of our project and we discuss whether we need put QR code in every postcard because some people do not know what it is. At the same time, we talked about if we need to store tourist's data in our database or just store the API in our database, then give the specific id and the common link to the tourists, they just need to alter the postfix of the link to their own, they can watch their own data visualization image.

## Design Session
At today's lecture, Marco Mason emphasize the project should be attractive enough and the importance of WHY.

## Feedback
After we explain the process of our project to Marco, he asked our why people will try our project? How can our project stand out from other projects? Where to set our vending machine? Why tourists care about our machine? All of these questions can help us perfect our project and become more competitive. Meanwhile, he gave us some useful suggestions as well. Firstly, to make our project more visible, we can switch the small screen to large screen. Secondly, we can settle our vending machine near the gift shop so if people wants to buy souvenir in the gift shop, then we can introduce our project to them. Thirdly, attract people's attention at the beginning, because some tourists need to catch the train or they are too tired to stand in front of the machine over five minutes. Fourthly, in the postcard part, he advise us make an extra story about the tourist's experience in the Fringe.
